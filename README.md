![Winstreak Intro](https://github.com/ewang2002/Winstreak.NET/blob/master/ws_github.png)
Winstreak is a program that is designed to ensure you, the player, can maintain a winstreak in Hypixel's popular Bedwars game.

## Technologies
- C# Programming Language
- .NET Core 3.1 

## Purpose
The creation of this program came as a frustration I had with Bedwars. One of the main issues I have with the game is that inexperienced Bedwars players can be placed in a lobby filled with extremely experienced players, thus making the game not so fun for inexperienced players.

My friends and I have often dealt with these experienced players. To say the least, it was not remotely fun when we're in a game with these players. 

A somewhat better solution, of course, would be putting players in lobbies with other players that have similar stats. But, of course, we all know Hypixel enjoys listening to their players. Plus, some experienced players often have alternative accounts designed to "disguise" their identity. 

## Features
Winstreak boasts several key features.
- **Lobby Checker**: Winstreak can check a lobby screenshot for any potential tryhards. The program will go through each player's stats and tell you if you should leave or not.
- **Game Checker**: Winstreak can check an in-game screenshot and will tell you exactly which team you should target or be careful around. It'll check each team's stats to show you where your team stands compared to opposing teams.
- **Group Checker**: For both lobby & game checkers, Winstreak will be able to check each player's friends to see if there are any potential parties.*
- **IGN Lookup**: You can directly type names into the console window to get an overview of a player's stats. And of course, you can put multiple names to compare them.

\* - Requires Hypixel API Key.

## Minecraft Versions
Winstreak can be used with any Minecraft version. Please refrain from using texture packs, especially texture packs that change the Minecraft font or colors.
