# Imaging Code Files
The following files (`ImageHelper.cs`, `Rgb.cs`, `SystemTools.cs`, and `UnmanagedImage.cs`) were taken from the [accord-net/framework](https://github.com/accord-net/framework/) repository and modified to suit my needs. Specifically, I removed unnecessary methods and changed the structuring of the code. 

I chose Accord.NET's implementation for basic image processing because of the significant speed increase when compared to .NET's implementation. 

The original source code for the following files can be found in the associated links.
- `UnmanagedImage.cs` can be found [here](https://github.com/accord-net/framework/blob/development/Sources/Accord.Imaging/AForge.Imaging/UnmanagedImage.cs).
- `Rgb.cs` can be found [here](https://github.com/accord-net/framework/blob/development/Sources/Accord.Imaging/Colors/RGB.cs). 
- `SystemTools.cs` can be found [here](https://github.com/accord-net/framework/blob/development/Sources/Accord.Core/AForge.Core/SystemTools.cs).
- Some methods in `ImageHelper.cs` were taken from different files in their repository.
